This repository demonstrates how to create a custom WordCloud using Python. The script reads text from a file, processes it, and generates a WordCloud in the shape of a specified mask image.

# Features
Generates a WordCloud with up to 500 words.
Customizable background color and colormap.
Uses a mask image to shape the WordCloud.
Outputs a visually appealing WordCloud.

# How It Works
Input Text: The script reads text data from a file (text.csv).
Mask Image: The shape of the WordCloud is based on a black-and-white mask image (text.jpg).
WordCloud Generation: The script processes the text and fills the mask shape with words.
Visualization: The WordCloud is displayed using Matplotlib for viewing and saving.

# Output
Below is an example of the generated WordCloud:
